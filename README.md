# purescript-hyper-routing-xhr

_Automatically derived XHR clients for Hyper routing types._

## Example

The example shows the integration of client and server based on a common
routing type for an API. XHR clients are generated by this package for all
endpoints, and the simple Pux application can safely request resources without
having to duplicate routing information and JSON encoding and decoding
instances.

```bash
cd example
bower install
npm install
make run-example
```
